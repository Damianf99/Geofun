# Geofun

This project was created for the "software engineering" subject in the University. The program which was uploaded to this repository was not the main part of the subject. It was a draft program containing only necessary functionalities which were needed for the final presentation. The core of this subject was to create a full software documentation of a given "idea". The assigned idea was to create a geography (subject) support system aimed at children from elementary schools (grades IV-VIII). This was my first project with the implementation of the PyQt5 module.

# Goal of the project

Help for elementary school children to learn geography in an accessible way. It is to contain as little textbook theory as possible, and as much important information as possible, written in a language that can be understood by children. The knowledge would coincide with the core curriculum for grades IV - VIII in terms of practical and theoretical knowledge, including learning about the landscapes of Poland and the world, using plans, maps, photos, drawings, charts, diagrams and statistical data, interpreting maps, using acquired knowledge and geographical skills in everyday life, the scope of environmental and nature protection, tourism.

# Additional information

The documentation consists of 85 pages with detailed explanation of conducting the whole project. It contains all the necessary aspects which are usually required in the software engineering documentation. If requested - I might share this document depending on the reason.
